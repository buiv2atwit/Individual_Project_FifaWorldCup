# Viet Hung Bui's individual project report

## Introduction 
The objective of this project is to practice using Jupiter Notebook. The World Cup 2022 is happening in Qarta. It catches an eye of millions people in the world and I am a fan of soccer as well so, I choose this topic for my final project in Data Science Fundamental so that It satisfy my passion and I can improve my skills for this Data Science Fundamental class. 

When I looked at the dataset. It was so many information and I wondered to myself that how can I know the winner of each world cup from the beginning up to now or how can I know the hosting of each world cup. Then I narrow down each table and get the result by the skills that I’ve learn in this class. Besides that, I’ve learn how to visualize the data so that it will be easier to present for other people
